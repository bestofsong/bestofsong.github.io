For simple commands that aren't undoable and don't require arguments, we can use a class template to parameterize the command's receiver. We'll define a template subclass SimpleCommand for such commands. SimpleCommand is parameterized by the Receiver type and maintains a binding between a receiver object and an action stored as a pointer to a member function.
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre>template &lt;class Receiver&gt;
class SimpleCommand : public Command {
  public:
    typedef void (Receiver::* Action)();
    SimpleCommand(Receiver* r, Action a) : _receiver(r), _action(a) { }
    virtual void Execute();
  private:
    Action _action;
    Receiver* _receiver;
};</pre>
  </p>

<p>
 The constructor stores the receiver and the action in the corresponding instance variables. Execute simply applies the action to the receiver. 
</p>

<p>
  <pre>template &lt;class Receiver&gt;
void SimpleCommand&lt;Receiver&gt;::Execute () {
  (_receiver->*_action)();
}</pre>
</p>

<p>To create a command that calls Action on an instance of class MyClass, a client simply writes</p>
<p><pre>MyClass* receiver = new MyClass; // ...
Command* aCommand =
new SimpleCommand&lt;MyClass&gt;(receiver, &amp;MyClass::Action); // ...
aCommand-&gt;Execute();</pre></p>

Keep in mind that this solution only works for simple commands. More complex commands that keep track of not only their receivers but also arguments and/or undo state require a Command subclass.
